## üöÄ Quick Start

### **Prerequisites**
- AWS account with administrative access
- Terraform >= 1.0
- Enterprise SAML identity provider (Okta, Azure AD, AWS Identity Center, etc.)
- Email address for security notifications

### **Deployment Steps**

1. **Clone and Configure**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd enterprise-federated-iam
   cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
   # Edit terraform.tfvars with your values
   ```

2. **Deploy Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

3. **Configure SAML Integration**
   - Create SAML application in your identity provider
   - Exchange metadata between identity provider and AWS
   - Configure role mappings and user assignments

4. **Test Federation**
   - Test SAML login through your identity provider
   - Verify role assumption and AWS Console access
   - Validate audit logging in CloudTrail

### **Required Configuration**

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `project_name` | Resource naming prefix | `"company-aws-federation"` |
| `aws_region` | Primary AWS region | `"us-east-1"` |
| `identity_account_id` | Your AWS account ID | `"123456789012"` |
| `notification_email` | Email for alerts | `"security@company.com"` |
| `saml_provider_name` | SAML provider name | `"CompanyIdP"` |

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

### **AWS Service Costs**
- **CloudTrail**: ~$2 per 100,000 management events
- **CloudWatch Logs**: $0.50 per GB ingested + $0.03 per GB stored
- **S3 Storage**: $0.023 per GB (standard tier)
- **SNS**: $0.50 per million email notifications
- **IAM**: No additional charges

### **Implementation Effort**
- **Infrastructure Deployment**: 1-2 days
