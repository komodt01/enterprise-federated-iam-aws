# Technologies Documentation - Enterprise Federated IAM Project

This document explains the key technologies used in the Enterprise Federated IAM project and how they work together to create a secure, scalable identity and access management solution.

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure as Code

### **Terraform**

**What it is**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision cloud infrastructure using declarative configuration files.

**How it works in this project**:
- **Declarative Configuration**: Infrastructure defined in `.tf` files using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)
- **State Management**: Tracks current state of infrastructure to enable updates and changes
- **Resource Dependencies**: Automatically determines the correct order to create/modify resources
- **Idempotent Operations**: Can be run multiple times safely without causing issues

**Key Benefits**:
- **Version Control**: Infrastructure changes tracked in Git
- **Reproducible Deployments**: Same configuration creates identical infrastructure
- **Automated Provisioning**: No manual clicking in AWS Console
- **Cost Management**: Easy to destroy and recreate environments

**Files in this project**:
```
main.tf           # Primary infrastructure definition
variables.tf      # Input variable definitions
terraform.tfvars  # Variable values and configuration
```

## üîê Identity and Access Management

### **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) 2.0**

**What it is**: XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between identity providers and service providers.

**How it works**:
1. **User Authentication**: User logs into Identity Provider (IdP)
2. **SAML Assertion**: IdP creates signed XML assertion containing user info and roles
3. **Service Provider**: AWS receives assertion and grants access based on mapped roles
4. **Session Creation**: Temporary AWS credentials created for specified duration

**Key Components**:
- **Identity Provider (IdP)**: Authenticates users (e.g., Okta, Azure AD, Auth0)
- **Service Provider (SP)**: Consumes assertions (AWS in this case)
- **Assertions**: XML documents containing authentication statements
- **Metadata**: XML configuration exchanged between IdP and SP

**SAML Flow in This Project**:
```
External IdP ‚Üí SAML Assertion ‚Üí AWS SAML Provider ‚Üí IAM Role ‚Üí AWS Console/API Access
```

### **Federated Identity**

**What it is**: Allows users to access multiple systems using a single set of credentials managed by a trusted identity provider.

**Benefits**:
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: One login for multiple systems
- **Centralized Management**: User accounts managed in one place
- **Enhanced Security**: No need to store credentials in each system
- **Compliance**: Centralized audit trail and access controls

### **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

**What it is**: Access control method where permissions are associated with roles, and users are assigned to roles.

**Implementation in this project**:
- **Developer Role**: PowerUser access with 8-hour sessions
- **ReadOnly Role**: View-only access with 4-hour sessions  
- **Admin Role**: Full access with 2-hour sessions (shorter for security)

**Security Principles**:
- **Least Privilege**: Users get minimum necessary permissions
- **Separation of Duties**: Different roles for different responsibilities
- **Time-limited Access**: Sessions expire to reduce risk
- **Audit Trail**: All role assumptions logged via CloudTrail

## üîí Security Technologies

### **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**

**What it is**: Framework for managing digital certificates and public-key encryption.

**Role in SAML**:
- **Digital Signatures**: SAML assertions signed by IdP private key
- **Verification**: AWS verifies signatures using IdP public key
- **Trust Establishment**: Certificates establish trust between IdP and SP
- **Tamper Protection**: Ensures assertions haven't been modified

### **JSON Web Tokens (JWT) vs SAML**

**SAML Tokens**:
- **Format**: XML-based
- **Use Case**: Enterprise SSO, especially for web applications
- **Security**: XML digital signatures
- **Size**: Larger due to XML verbosity

**JWT Tokens** (alternative approach):
- **Format**: JSON-based
- **Use Case**: Modern web APIs, mobile applications
- **Security**: JSON Web Signatures (JWS)
- **Size**: Smaller and more efficient
